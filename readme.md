# Watson
## The Trusty Helper for [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock)!

To use:

Press âŒ˜ + SPACE to bring up spotlight, type ```Terminal``` then ENTER.

Type ```pip3 install sherlock-project``` you can change out ```pip3``` for ```pipx```, if needed, then press ENTER.

Type ```which sherlock```, press ENTER, then copy the output, ours was ```/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/sherlock```

Run Watson.py, when "Search" is hit the first time, it will ask for the Sherlock PATH, Paste from earlier (eg. ```/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/sherlock```). It will not need this again as it is saved in a PATH.watson file, which can be edited in TextEdit if needed.


Enjoy!!
